          Within the article “A Guide to Becoming a Full-Stack Developer in 2017” the author discusses important skills for full-stack developers to have based on his own experiences as well as what is currently being taught to students. Developers need to be able to work on both front-end and back-end technologies for an application, so they must have basic understandings of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, web storage, databases, HTTP, REST, web application architecture, Git, script algorithm analysis, and back-end languages. HTML and CSS focus on front-end visuals for web applications while Javascript is very popularly used for full-stack, front-end and back-end development, so it is good to know as there is a high likelihood any developer will use it. HTTP, REST, databases, web storage, and general web application architecture are all concepts that will need to be taken into consideration when developing web applications since developers have to understand how their web app is being run. SQL and Javascript are very heavily used on the back-end development, but C# and Python are also used a lot so it is good to have an understanding of multiple back-end languages. Analysis of algorithms will help to optimize scripts in terms of computational costs to make efficient code.

            On a similar note “Roadmap to becoming a web developer in 2018” focuses on different paths one could take as a developer and discusses front-end, back-end, and DevOps paths. In this article, Git, terminal navigation, data structures and algorithms, GitHub, licenses, semantic versioning, SSH, HTTPS, APIs, design patterns and character encodings are all necessary for developers to have knowledge of. For front-end, a developer needs to have knowledge of how Internet works and the aspects surrounding it, the basics of HTML and CSS, Javascript and it’s APIs including Fetch, Ajax, and Document Object Model (DOM), Git and GitHub, npm and yarn as package managers, Webpack as module bundlers, React.js and Redux, testing with Jest react Enzyme and Cypress, CSS frameworks, TypeScript, and React Native for mobile applications. If a developer is going into a back-end area then they should have knowledge of some basic frontend knowledge like Internet, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, OS and basic networking concepts, Javascript and maybe a few other languages like Python, Git, GitHub, SQL for relational database knowledge and MongoDB for NoSQL databases, Authentication and JSON APIs, caching on client, CDN, and server side, integration testing, unit testing, functional testing, web security including HTTPS and SSL, Architectural patterns such as Monolithic apps and microservices, search engines, message brokers, Docker, containerization, virtualization, GraphQL, web servers, Migration strategies, horizontal scaling, vertical scaling, observability to help with debugging and metrics logging. DevOps is a subset of back-end developing and focuses more on learning Go, OS concepts, Operating Systems, managing servers, do everything in terminal, networking, security and protocols such as HTTPS, SSH, and Port Forwarding, reverse proxy, forward proxy, caching server, load balancer, firewall, web server, infrastructure as code such as containers, configuration management, container orchestration, infrastructure provisioning, and service mesh, some CI/CD tool, infrastructure monitoring, application monitoring, logs management, cloud providers, and cloud design patterns.

            The second article seemed to focus on all the different paths that a developer could take in what they should learn to focus on what part of developing they want to pursue and just listed out aspects of each idea.  In contrast the first article gave a more general consensus on what most developers need to know no matter what field they are in as well as explaining why those skills are needed.
